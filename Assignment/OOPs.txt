OOP:--> OOP stands for object oriented programming, it is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.
-> OOP is faster and easier to execute.
-> OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
-> OOP makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
-> OOP makes it possible to create full reusable application with less code and shorter development time.

OOP Concepts:-->
1.Class: class is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
2.Object: object is an instance of a class.
3.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a process of wrapping(bundling) the data(variables) and methods(functions)
  in a single entity (class).
4.Inheritance: Inheritance allows a child class(derived) to inherit properties and behaviors from parent class(base).
5.Polymorphism: when one class having same method name but different parameters (method overloading),
  when parent class and child class having same method name (method overriding).
6.Abstraction: Abstraction is a process to hiding unnecessary details from the user.
7.Constructor: Constructor is a special method that will call automatically when we create object.

Difference between OOP and POP:-->
OOP: OOP is centered around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes modeling the
     problem domain using objects, encapsulating data and behavior into classes, and defining relationships 
     between objects.

POP: POP is centered around procedures or functions. It focuses on decomposing a problem into a set of procedures 
     or functions that perform specific tasks and operate on data.
